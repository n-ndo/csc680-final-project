Note:
 Due to my other team member not owning a MacOS, most of the pushes were done on my Mac.
 However, they were times where we met up and worked on the project together such as 
 talking about how we'll set it up and connecting everything. He was also responsible for
 some of the designs/wireframes for the app.
